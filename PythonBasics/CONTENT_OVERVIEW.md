# üß≠ Python Basics - CONTENT OVERVIEW

**PythonBasics** project gathers all weekly lectures, organized in **ascending order** intentionally to ensure correct sequential understanding. 

üß© Each exercise represents a ***core building block of knowledge*** extracted directly from the Python classes. 

These scripts encapsulate the key concepts that shaped my understanding of the Python language, providing a solid foundation for further learning. 

üöÄ Take it step by step, explore the code, and enjoy the process!

### üìù Notes  
Throughout this project, you‚Äôll find small visual cues to make learning smoother:  

üåÄ ‚Üí marks when a new concept or piece of knowledge is introduced.  
üí° NOTE: ‚Üí highlights important ideas or clarifications.  
‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: ‚Üí points out key details or things to watch carefully.
1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ 4Ô∏è‚É£ ... ‚Üí separate topics within the same lecture for easier reading.  

Everything is fully commented so you can easily follow the logic and understand the knowledge behind each exercise. üí¨
