# 🧠 Python Basics

This section brings together the most important notes from Python lecture & practical classes. 🐍💡  

The examples are meant to be read in ascending order:  
👉 **00, 01, 02, 03**, and so on — so you can follow the learning flow step by step.  

Feel free to download them and run the code on your own machine! 👨💻  

There might still be a few things I’ve missed (it happens 😅), so please keep that in mind.  
If you find something that could be added or improved, feel free to let me know so we can grow this portfolio together and make it even better for everyone. 🤝
