# 🐍 Python Foundation Year – ELTE ePortfolio

Welcome to my **ePortfolio** for **Python beginners**.

I’ve put together what I think really matters when you’re trying to make sense of this awesome language 🧠🐍 — and what you learn through trial and error (mostly error, to be honest)! 😆  

You’ll find concise and powerful knowledge that come from the **Python lecture & practical classes** of ELTE's Foundation Year.

👉 You can start exploring here:  
[📘 **PythonBasics 🧠** – Dive into the fundamentals!](PythonBasics/README.md)

If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions, please don’t hesitate to let me know — I’d love to improve it together.  

And feel free to share this portfolio with anyone who might find it useful — learning is better when it’s shared! 🌍

Thanks for stopping by — now grab a cup of tea 🍵 and let’s dive into Python together! 🚀
